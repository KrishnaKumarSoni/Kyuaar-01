## Test Automation Updates

**To Backend Developer:** Auth implementation detected - uses Flask-Login instead of JWT. Need User model and packet models for comprehensive testing.

**Testing Progress:**
-  Test framework configured (pytest, coverage, fixtures)
- = Auth tests written but need User model to run
- � Packet state transition tests pending backend models
- � File upload tests need packets blueprint

**Requirements for Testing:**
1. User model class with get_by_email, create, check_password methods
2. Packet model with state transitions (setup_pending -> setup_done -> config_pending -> config_done)
3. Pricing calculation logic
4. File upload handling in packets blueprint

**Blocking Issues:**
- Cannot run auth tests without User model implementation
- Need packet blueprint structure for integration tests
